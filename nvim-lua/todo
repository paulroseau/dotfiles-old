use packer instead of VimPlug

treesitter = compiler of incremental parsers that return a tree strucutre of your file
 - useful for better syntax highligting
 - useful for better folds
 - shortcuts to replace expressions, function bodies etc. (ie. small refactoring)

telescope = slower but nicer replacement to fzf 
  maybe to be used in conjunction with fzf ?
